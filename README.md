## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster (or local MongoDB)
- API keys for [Groq](https://console.groq.com), [Resend](https://resend.com), and [Upstash Redis](https://console.upstash.com)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1khushibarnwal/Scribly.git
cd Scribly
```

### 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/notes_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_long_random_secret
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=a_different_long_random_secret
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_upstash_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_upstash_token
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5001
```

Run it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Frontend setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `frontend/.env`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

Run it:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`.

## Deployment

Scribly supports two deployment approaches:

### Option A — Split hosting (frontend + backend separately)

- **Backend (Render):** Root directory `backend`, build command `npm install`, start command `node src/server.js`. Add all backend `.env` variables in Render's dashboard, plus `NODE_ENV=production` and `CLIENT_URL` set to your deployed frontend URL.
- **Frontend (Vercel):** Root directory `frontend`, framework preset Vite. Add `VITE_API_URL` pointing to your deployed backend URL + `/api`.
- **MongoDB Atlas:** allow network access from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`) since Render doesn't use a fixed IP.

### Option B — Single host

The root `package.json` supports building and running both frontend and backend from one service:

```bash
npm run build   # installs both frontend & backend deps, builds the frontend
npm start        # runs the backend, which serves the built frontend as static files
```

Use this if deploying to a single platform (e.g. one Render web service) rather than splitting frontend/backend across two hosts. In this mode, `CLIENT_URL` and `VITE_API_URL` aren't needed since everything is served from the same origin.

## Security Notes

- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage.
- Access tokens are short-lived (15 min) and never persisted; refresh tokens are httpOnly cookies, invalidated in the database on logout.
- All note routes are scoped to the authenticated user — no cross-account access is possible.
- All request bodies are validated server-side with Zod, independent of frontend validation.
- Password reset always returns a generic success message, regardless of whether the email exists, to avoid leaking registered emails.
